# Experience
## **Undergraduate Research Assistant**

*RN, Brazil*

*Jun 2023 – Apr 2024*

*Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte*

- Collaborated with the development of automated cardiovascular diagnosis tools by applying Deep Learning and **Computer Vision** algorithms to medical datasets.

- Refined data preparation pipelines by implementing noise reduction and feature extraction techniques, enhancing training data quality on **resource contrained hardware**.



# Projects
## **[Minke](https://github.com/enfmarinho/Minke) | C++, Rust, Bullet ML Framework, CMake, Make, Git**

*May 2024 – present*

- Attained **\#2 ranking** among Brazilian chess engines on the Computer Chess Rating List (CCRL).

- Engineered **SIMD-vectorized kernels** for **x86 and ARM** architectures to optimize neural network inference and integrated NNUE network evaluation, **increasing search throughput by +105%** and **engine strength by +75%.**

- Optimised the search engine by implementing bitboard representations and cache-efficient memory layouts, achieving a **27% speedup** in negamax algorithm.

- Analyzed performance and memory profiles using **LLDB and Valgrind**, debugging and ensuring stable execution of high-concurrency algorithms.



## **Comp | C++, Flex, Bison, Make, Git**

*Mar 2025 – Jul 2025*

- Constructed a compiler prototype using Flex and Bison to **lower a custom language** into Three-Address Code (TAC).

- Developed code-generation backend that translates TAC into portable C enabling integration with **GCC/Clang toolchains** for **hardware-specific cross-compilation.**

- Designed a linear **Intermediate Representation** (IR) to support IR-level optimizations, mirroring the logic used in firmware to **minimize instruction count and memory footprint.**

- Executed **semantic analysis passes**, including symbol table construction and static type checking, **ensuring program correctness** prior to IR lowering.



## **[Tgames](https://github.com/enfmarinho/tgames) | Rust, Cargo, Git**

*Feb 2024 – Apr 2024*

- Architected a **high-performance** terminal UI engine in Rust, enabling **asynchronous input** and state-driven rendering for a suite of 5 mini-games.

- Published on crates.io with **9,200+ downloads**, demonstrating real-world adoption and production-quality code.

- Designed a **modular architecture** using Rust traits and enums, applying design patterns to ensure the system is **extensible** and **fault-tolerant.**



## **Pasture Biomass Prediction | Python, PyTorch, Vision Transformers**

*Oct 2025 – present*

- Engineered an **automated ML and inference pipeline** integrating ensemble prediction and Test Time Augmentation (TTA), **improving accuracy by 11%.**

- Incorporated a pre-trained **DINOv2 Vision Transformer (ViT-S/14)** as backbone with a **shared feature extractor** and 4 auxiliary heads to automate biomass estimation from ground images.

- Leveraged **multitask learning** with auxiliary metadata to improve generalization, validated via 5-fold cross-validation.
